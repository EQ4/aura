AURA Universal REST API
=======================

AURA is an API specification for music libraries. Music players---from HTML5
applications to mobile apps to embedded devices---can use AURA to talk to
servers that host a catalog of music.

AURA is a lightweight and open alternative to the `DLNA`_ protocols and ad-hoc
proprietary interfaces such as `DAAP`_.
